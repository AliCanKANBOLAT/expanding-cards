Expanding Cards Readme

Overview:
This project implements an "Expanding Cards" feature using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The expanding cards provide an interactive and visually appealing way to showcase images with accompanying titles. The layout is designed to be responsive, and it includes a smooth transition effect when clicking on each card.

Instructions:
HTML Structure:

The HTML file (index.html) is structured with a container-fluid, rows, and columns using Bootstrap.
Cards are represented as div elements with the class "area," each containing an image and a title.
Styling:

The styling is defined in the style.css file, where Bootstrap is used for layout responsiveness.
The card design includes a background image, a title, and a transition effect for a polished user experience.
Media Queries:

Media queries are implemented for responsive design, adapting the layout for screens with a maximum width of 600 pixels.
Font sizes and layout proportions are adjusted for smaller screens.
Fonts:

Google Fonts are imported to enhance the typography of the project, providing a modern and visually pleasing appearance.
JavaScript Functionality:

The main.js file contains JavaScript code that enables the expanding card functionality.
Clicking on a card expands it while contracting any other open card, providing a seamless user experience.
Dependencies:
Bootstrap (v5.3.2): Used for responsive layout and styling.
